# Wallet widget for the IDEO+CoinList Hackathon  
## Web-wallet widget as the next step in solving the onboarding problem
This branch of the monorepo contains the code for white-label web-wallet widget we're building for the [IDEO + CoinList hackathon](https://coinlist.co/build/ideo).  
 
Our team has a long history of focusing on the crypto onboarding problem. Specifically, on getting users for dapps outside of the existing crypto userbase. We're started out with onboarding users to crypto by claimable links - linkdrop.io.  

After we've [launched the Dashboard](https://medium.com/linkdrophq/https-medium-com-linkdrophq-dashboard-launch-d8b3a2c8eec9) to generate linkdrop marketing campaigns, we learned that we solved only one part of the onboarding problem for users: getting crypto to try out the dapp. We figured that installing separate software (chromse extention or mobile app) to try a dapp is too much to ask for mainstream user.    
  
That's why for the scope of the IDEO+CoinList hackathon, we decided to solve this problem by building a white-label wallet widget (think Intercom, but for crypto wallet), which any dapp can easily customize and integrate natively. We believe in combination with linkdrop campaigns the webwallet will provide dapps the powerful tooling to attract and retain non-crypto users.  

## Wallet features
- White-label: configure and integrate in minutes via widget/SDK  
- Custom design and ENS domain   
- Based on Meta Txs for the best UX: gasless transactions, built-in modules and more  
- Google Drive for non-custodial recovery  
- ENS Login for dapps interoperability. Among other wallet teams (including Authereum, Portis, Torus) we're working on the new loign standard. [Learn more](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/discussion-ens-login/3569)  
- Build-in on-ramping
- Native linkdrops (WIP, has good potential for p2p onboarding via shareable links and p2p double referral programs similar to Paypal, Uber, etc.)   

## Linkdrop + web-wallet = magical crypto on-boarding    
1. Open the link in regular browser   
2. Sign in with google/icloud  
3. Get tokens in one click  
Youâ€™ve got crypto wallet, ENS to login to dapps and crypto to use the dapp in 3 clicks!!!

## Code structure

**Wallet-codebase (in scope for the IDEO+CoinList hackathon):**
- [wallet](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/apps/app-claim) - web-wallet widget code
- [wallet-provider](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/apps/app-claim) - web3 provider for dapps to integrate the widget wallet
- [Dapp example](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/apps/app-claim) - to show how dapps can use linkdrop campaigns and web-wallet in combination for the best onboarding experience, we've build an example dapp based on the ZRX Instant. We've deployed it publicly here - https://zrx-instant-demo.linkdrop.io/

**Original Linkdrop-specific codebase:**
- [Contracts](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/contracts) - linkdrop contracts
- [Server](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/server) - node.js server application that relays claiming transactions so that end-users don't need to have ether to claim linkdrops
- [SDK](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/sdk) - a JS library to generate and claim links (used in web apps)
- [Scripts](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/packages/scripts)  - scripts for setting up, deploying, generating links and claiming linkdrops
- [Configs](https://github.com/LinkdropHQ/linkdrop-monorepo/tree/master/configs) - configs used in other components (SDK, server, web apps)
